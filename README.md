# Website-Speed-Check-Chrome-Extension
On click, searches the domain of the current tab on Google's PageSpeed Insights, and shows the results in a new tab.

This is my first chrome extension, and I hope to do many more in the future. Any feedback, suggestions and/or contributions are highly appreciated.
